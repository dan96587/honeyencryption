# honeyencryption

In this project, we extend the scope of honey encryption proposed in the original paper [JR2014] by aiming to develop a honey encryption scheme for a simple messaging service supporting short messages (~50 characters). In addition, we will attempt to implement the conceptual encryption protocols defined in the paper. We will design a message space and develop an accurate probability distribution for the message space. With this distribution, we will implement the encryption and decryption protocols for the inverse sampling DTE function described in [JR2014]. Below we describe some of the challenges we anticipate facing, our thoughts on addressing these challenges, and resources we can use to be successful. Additionally, we propose some smaller scale projects that can be implemented if the simple messaging service ends up being too hard or too easy.
